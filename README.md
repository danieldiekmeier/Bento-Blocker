# Bento-Blocker
Block links to Bento.de on the Homepage of Spiegel Online

## Motivation

As [Michel Honold](https://twitter.com/michelhonold) rightly put it:
> Ich habe ja kein Problem mit der Werbung auf @SPIEGELONLINE, aber kann ich bitte einen Blocker f√ºr Teaser zu @bento_de haben?

And so I wrote one. It catches all the links to Bento that were there when I wrote this script. They may appear in other places in the future, so feel free to tell me about it or send some pull requests.

## Installation

If you're using Google Chrome, you can just go to `chrome://extensions/` and drag and drop the `bentoBlocker.user.js` there. You can probably also use the [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=de)/[Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) plugins for your browser of choice.
